# nom
> Feed me

`nom` is a terminal based RRS feed reader using [Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) styled markdown to improve the reading experience and a simple TUI using [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).
- Local sync and offline reading
- Backend connections (miniflux, freshrss supported)
- Vim style keybindings for navigation
- Plenty more features such as mark read/unread, filtering and feed naming

## Install
See [releases](https://github.com/guyfedwards/nom/releases) for binaries. E.g.
```sh
$ curl -L https://github.com/guyfedwards/nom/releases/download/v2.1.4/nom_2.1.4_darwin_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xzvf -
```

## Usage
```sh
$ nom # start TUI
$ nom add <feed_url> <optional feed_name>
$ nom -h # see all available command and options
```

## Config
Config lives by default in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nom/config.yml` or `$HOME/Library/Application Support/nom/config.yml` on darwin.  
You can customise the location of the config file with the `--config-path` flag.

### Feeds
Feeds are added to the config file and have a url and name.
```yaml
feeds:
  - url: https://dropbox.tech/feed
    # name will be prefixed to all entries in the list
    name: dropbox 
  - url: https://snyk.io/blog/feed
```
You can also add feeds with the `add` command:
```sh
$ nom add <url> <optional feed_name>
```
Feeds are editable within `nom` by pressing `E` to open the config in your `$EDITOR` or `$NOMEDITOR`. After editing feeds, you will need to then refresh with `r`.

#### Youtube feeds
To add youtube feeds you can go to a channel and run the following in the browser console to get the rss feed link:
```js
console.log(`https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=${document.querySelector("link[rel='canonical']").href.split('/channel/').reverse()[0]}`)
```

### Show read (default: false)
Show read items by default. (can be toggled with M)
```yaml
showread: true
```
### Auto read (default: false)
Automatically mark items as read on selection or navigation through items. 
```yaml
autoread: true
```

### Ordering
Set the default sort ordering of the list
```yaml
ordering: asc
```

### Filtering
Default to include the feedname prefix in filtering query. Removes need to use `f:xxx` for simple queries. This will mean that multi-feed filters won't work, e.g. `f:xxx f:yyy`
```yaml
filtering: 
  defaultIncludeFeedName: true
```


### Theme 
Theme allows some basic color overrides in the feed view and then setting a custom markdown render theme for the overall markdown view. `theme.glamour` can be one of "dark", "dracula", "light", "pink", "ascii" or "notty". See [here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour/tree/master/styles/gallery) for previews and more info.
Colors can be hex or ASCII codes, they will be coerced depending on your terminal color settings.
```yaml
theme: 
  glamour: dark
  titleColor: "62"
  titleColorFg: "231"
  selectedItemColor: "170"
  filterColor: "#555555"
```

### Backends
As well as adding feeds directly, you can pull in feeds from another source. You can add multiple backends and the feeds will all be added.
```yaml
backends:
  miniflux:
    host: http://myminiflux.foo
    api_key: jafksdljfladjfk
  freshrss:
    host: http://myfreshrss.bar
    user: admin
    password: muchstrong
    prefixCats: true # prefix feed name for freshrss entries
```

#### FreshRSS
To use freshrss you need to enable API access and set the API password explicitly, separate to your user password.
1. To enable the API go to Settings > Authentication > Allow API access.  
1. You can set the API password in Settings > Profile > API password.  

### Openers
By default links are opened in the browser, you can specify commands to open certain links based on a regex string.   
`regex` can be any valid golang regex string, it will be matched against the feed item link.  
`cmd` is run as a child command. The `%s` denotes the position of the link in the command.  
`takeover` dictates if the command should takeover the tty from nom. E.g. for opening links in lynx or other TUI.  
```yaml
openers:
  - regex: "youtube"
    cmd: "mpv %s"
  - regex: ".*"
    cmd: "lynx %s"
    takeover: true
```

## Store
`nom` uses sqlite as a store for feeds and metadata. It is stored next to the config in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nom/nom.db`. This can be backed up like any file and will store articles, read state etc. It can also be deleted to start from scratch redownloading all articles and no state.

The name of the sqlite file can be overridden in the config file, allowing you to have multiple configs each with their own data store.

```yaml
database: news.db
```

## Filtering
Within the `nom` view, you can filter by title pressing the `/` character. Filters can be applied easily. Here's some examples:
- `f:my_feed feed:my_second_feed` - matches `my_feed` and `my_second_feed`
- `feedname:"my feed - with spaces"` - matches `my feed - with spaces`
- `feed:'my feed, with single quotes!'` - matches `my feed, with single quotes!`
- `feed:my\ feed\ with\ escaped\ spaces!` - matches `my feed with escaped spaces!`

### Include feedname in filtering
If you want to include the feedname in the default filtering query, use `config.filtering.defaultIncludeFeedName: true`. This simplifies the above `f:xxx` queries but means that you can't filter by multiple feeds at once, e.g. `f:xxx f:yyy`.

More filters to be added soon!

## Building and Running via Docker
Build nom image
```sh
docker build -t nom .
```
This embeds the local docker-config.yml file into the container and will be used by default.

Running the nom via docker
```sh
docker run --rm -it nom
```
Use the `-v` command line argument to mount a local config onto `/app/docker-config.yml` as desired.


## Dev setup
You can use the `backends-compose.yml` to spin up a local instance of miniflux and freshrss if needed for development.

```sh
$ docker-compose -f backends-compose.yml up
```

### Debug logging
You can enable logging to a file using the `DEBUGNOM` env var. Passing any path will cause `log` calls to write there e.g. `DEBUGNOM=debug.log`
